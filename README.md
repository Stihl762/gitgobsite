# NetGoblin: The Hunt Begins

This repository powers the official NetGoblin website.
It’s quiet now — static, calm, watching.
But make no mistake, it remembers every byte that passes through its domain.

## A Word From The Goblin

> "Careful, traveler. This code isn’t abandoned treasure.
> Fork it, steal it, or strip its name,
> and the Goblin will know your IP, your build logs,
> and the whisper of your keyboard before you even hit run."

He laughs quietly, his amber eyes dimming just enough to make you question it.

Then, softly:

> “Leave it be, or She’ll signal me…”
